# React Post List App

## Description

This project is a **React-based web application** that fetches and displays posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It demonstrates the use of **React**, **Redux** for state management, **Axios** for API requests, **React Router DOM** for routing, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

### Features:
- **Post List**: Fetches and displays a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- **Post Details**: When a post is clicked, it displays the post's title, body, and associated comments.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar allows users to filter posts by title.
- **Pagination**: A basic pagination feature to navigate through the posts.
- **State Management**: Uses **Redux** to manage the state of posts and search data.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS** to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: Functional components, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Redux**: For global state management
- **React Router DOM**: For routing between different views
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Axios**: For making API requests
- **Vite**: For fast development and build setup
